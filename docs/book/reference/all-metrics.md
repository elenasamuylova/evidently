description: List of all metrics available in Evidently.

How to read the tables:

* **Metrics**: the name of the metric, and available parameters.  
* **Description**: plain text explanation of the metric. We also specify whether the metric applies to the whole dataset or individual columns.
* **Default**: description of the default parameters. 

We organize the metrics into logical groups. Note that the groups do not match the presets with the same name, e.g., there are more Data Quality metrics below than in the `DataQualityPreset`.

**Metric visualizations**. Each metric also includes a default render. To see the visualization, navigate to the [example notebooks](../get-started/examples.md).
