description: List of all metrics available in Evidently.

How to read the tables:

* **Metrics**: the name of the metric, and available parameters.  
* **Description**: plain text explanation of the metric. We also specify whether the test applies to the whole dataset or individual columns.
* **Default**: description of the default parameters. 
* 
We organize the metrics into logical groups. Note that the groups do not match the presets with the same name, e.g., there are more Data Quality metrics below than in the `DataQualityPreset`.

Each metric includes a default render. To see the visualization, navigate to the example notebooks.
